# TIFF2PNG Image Converter

A super simple tool for easily batch converting 16-bit .TIFF files to 8-bit .png images.
I got annoyed having to open up all the images I downloaded from textures.com in photoshop, converting them to 8-bit and saving them as .PNG, so I made a simple .exe to batch do it for me.

## Installation
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Corvo2408/TIFF2PNG/releases) and place the .exe file anywhere on your system.

## Usage
To use this tool, simply drag any images you want to convert onto the .exe and it'll convert them and place the results in the same location as the originals.
